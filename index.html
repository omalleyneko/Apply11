                <p>When preparing for an interview, you should carefully read over the job description and use it as a guide. See what qualifications and qualities the employer is looking for and see if your skills match these details. Consider why this job is a good fit for you and why you would be the best person suited for the role. Perform research on the company and the role. This will help give you context for interview conversations and allow you to have thoughtful questions prepared.</p>

                <p>Research will be one of the best tools to prepare you for an interview. This can include any products or services that are related to the role you are applying for. This will show the interviewer that you are prepared and interested in the company's current or past projects. Consider your answers to common interview questions and do a few mockup interviews. This can be done with another person, or  YouTube videos that can help.</p>
